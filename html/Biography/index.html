	<p style="color:white;font-size:20px;padding-left:300px;padding-right:300px;">•   My name is Abdullah Gilacio Bakhsh and I'm 13 years old. I'm currently studying in Makati Science Highschool as Grade 8 student. My favorite color is blue, cyan, and gray while my favorite dessert is ice cream with the flavor Cookies & Cream. The animal I like the most are the badgers due to they're fearlessness. They are so brave that they even take on lions sometimes.</p>

	<p style="color:white;font-size:20px;padding-left:300px;padding-right:300px;">•   One of my hobbies is reading. I often read some books and most of them are from the fantasy genre. I have read the Harry Potter series, Percy Jackson Series, Count Karlstein, The Thief Lord, and Desolate Era. I also often play Minecraft. I especially enjoy making command creations for it. I also like program on my computer. So far, I've learned how to code in Scratch and Python while I dabbled in HTML and a bit of CSS. Some of my best creations are a Task Manager in Python and a Zombie Shooter game in Scratch.</p>

	<p style="color:white;font-size:20px;padding-left:300px;padding-right:300px;">•   When I was on my sixth grade, I participated in an extracurricular activity, Journalism. I was recommended by my English teacher to the club and I was given the position of English Feature Writing. My Instructor taught me many different things about writing. I also participated in a writing competetion so I have some experience in writing. I've also finished fifth grade and sixth as a "Honor" achiever. On sixth grade, I also participated in a Science Quiz Bee competetion and got a 2nd place on the District Level. Elementary was a wild ride and a good experience. </p>
